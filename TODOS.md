# Shorter-term TODOs

* Better option for saving all outputs. Images should be placed in a folder and/or there should be a dialog for folder and filenames.
* Enable pan
* Freeze label
* Fill function
* Adjust brightness of loaded image and transparency of label
* Add other types of processing functions! This includes SIFT features, PCA features, Gaussian-derivative features, multiscale features...

# Longer-term TODOs
* Add slice-wise 3D functionality.
* Add undo (for example using 3-step image buffer)
